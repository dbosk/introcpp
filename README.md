introprog
===============================================================================

This is the source code for assignments and instructions for an introductory 
course in programming.  The language used is C++, but can easily be generalized 
to Python (work-in-progress).

It was developed by Daniel Bosk and Martin Kjellqvist, both at Mid Sweden 
University, in 2012.
